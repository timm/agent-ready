A multi-disciplinary, multi-site attempt at developing, understanding, and applying a cognitive architecture capable of supporting general intelligence. Research spanned areas such as machine learning, problem solving and planning, production systems, intelligent agents, virtual humans, multi-agent systems, knowledge-based systems, neural networks, and cognitive modeling. The most significant applications were intelligent automated pilots and commanders for synthetic battlespaces, as deployed in Synthetic Theater of War '97 (STOW-97)

= Inside SOAR =

All tasks in Soar are formulated as attempts to achieve
goals in problem spaces (Newell et al. 1991). Each
problem space consists of a set of states and a set of
operators. States represent situations, and operators
represent actions. Operators perform the basic deliberate
acts of the system. They can perform simple, primitive
actions that modify the internal state (such as
determining if all commit criteria are achieved) and/or
generate primitive external actions (such as switching
radar modes), or they can perform arbitrarily complex
actions, such as executing a mission. The basic processing
cycle is to repeatedly propose, select, and
apply operators of the problem space to a state, moving
ahead one decision at a time. Operator selection,
application, and termination are all dynamically determined
by the system’s knowledge.

For expert-level performance, sufficient knowledge
is generally available so that the selection of the next
appropriate operator is not problematic. However,
when operator-selection knowledge is insufficient to
determine the next operator to apply, an impasse
occurs, leading to the creation of a subgoal to determine
which operator should be selected (possibly
through some search or planning technique [Rosenbloom,
Lee, and Unruh 1993; Laird, Newell, and
Rosenbloom 1987]). Similarly, if an operator is too
complex or unfamiliar for the available application
knowledge to handle directly, an impasse occurs, leading
to the creation of a subgoal to apply the operator.
This type of operator and associated subgoal is ubiquitous
in TacAir-Soar, where operators such as intercept
are selected and, in turn, lead to a goal in which operators
specific to intercepts, such as plan-interceptgeometry
or employ-missile, are proposed, selected,
and applied to carry out the intercept. This is a goaldecomposition
scheme in which the decomposition of
a goal is not static but is determined step by step as
operators are dynamically selected and applied. Thus,
subgoals arise during the process of selecting and
applying operators, leading to the dynamic generation
of a goal hierarchy. These subgoals disappear when
the associated impasse is resolved, either because an
operator can be selected or because a selected operator
is terminated.

Each problem space for each goal in the hierarchy
has its own state. Each such state includes a representation
of all its supergoals (and their states)—Soar’s
subgoals are functionally at the metalevel (Rosenbloom,
Laird, and Newell 1988)—plus, possibly, representations
that are local to the particular goal and
problem space. The top state includes all sensor data
from the external environment, which is thus also
available in all subgoals. At any time, states at any level
of the goal hierarchy can change, usually through
the changing of sensor values. Because Soar’s knowledge
is also active for all levels, an operator can terminate
at any level of the hierarchy—including intermediate
levels—at any time. Such a termination
automatically flushes all lower levels of the hierarchy
and can lead to the selection of a new operator to
replace the terminated one.

All Soar’s knowledge, be it for selection, application,
or termination of operators, is stored in the form of
productions (condition-action rules). Any changes in
goals, states, and perceptions can cause these productions
to fire. There is no conflict resolution, so all applicable
productions are allowed to fire in parallel. Operator-
selection knowledge consists of productions that
test the current goal or state and generate symbolic
preferences about the absolute or relative worth of
operators. For example, given a particular situation, a
production might generate a preference that an operator
to turn left is better than an operator to turn
right. As the state changes, some preferences can be
retracted (if the situation no longer matches the conditions
of the rules that generated them) and others
generated, so that decisions—which are made by a
fixed, architectural decision procedure—can always be
based on preferences relevant to the current situation.
Operator-application knowledge consists of productions
that modify the state in accordance with the particular
operator selected and, possibly, generate output commands.
Operator-termination knowledge consists of
productions that test the state and generate a termination
signal if the state corresponds to what the
operator is to accomplish.

Goals and their results form the basis of Soar’s learning
mechanism, chunking. Chunking acquires new
productions, called chunks, that summarize the processing
that leads to subgoal results, that is, to elements
generated in subgoals that are accessible in
supergoals. A chunk’s actions are based on these
results. Its conditions are based on those aspects of
the supergoals that are relevant to the determination
of the results. Once a chunk is learned, it can fire in
relevantly similar future situations, directly producing
the required result and possibly avoiding the impasse
that led to its formation. This chunking process is a
form of explanation-based learning (Mitchell, Keller,
and Kedar-Cabelli 1986; Rosenbloom and Laird 1986).

= SOAR's Operator Hierarchy and STOW-07 =

(See Figure 10).

In the top-most problem space (top-PS), LL
is attempting to accomplish its mission by
applying the execute-mission operator. The termination
condition of this operator is the
completion of LL’s mission (which is to protect
its home base for a mission-specified
time period). Because this condition has not
yet been achieved, a subgoal is generated to
complete the application of execute-mission.

The execute-mission problem space is selected
for use in this subgoal. In this problem
space, LL selects the intercept operator to perform
the intercept. The termination condition
of this operator—that the opponents are
either destroyed or chased away—is also not
yet achieved, leading to a second subgoal of
completing the intercept. 

The intercept problem
space is selected for use in this goal.
Within this problem space, LL selects the
employ-missile operator, which uses missiles to
either destroy the opponents or force them to
run away. However, because LL has not
reached a position from which it can fire a
missile, a third subgoal is generated.

The
employ-missile problem space is selected for
use in this subgoal. Within this problem
space, LL attempts to achieve a firing position
for its missile by selecting the get-missile-LAR
operator. (LAR stands for launch acceptability
region, that is, the region from which LL can
effectively fire a missile at its opponents).
Because such a position has not been
achieved, a fourth subgoal is generated, and
the get-missile-LAR problem space is selected
for it. 

Here, the cut-to-LS operator is selected
to achieve lateral separation. Finally, the cutto-
LS operator leads to a fifth subgoal, within
which the desired-maneuver problem space
is selected. Within this space, the just-turn
operator is selected and applies directly to
issue a new heading command to the cockpit
interface, causing the aircraft to turn in an  attempt to achieve lateral separation.

As LL turns, if the termination conditions
of any of the operators in the hierarchy are
satisfied, then the operator is terminated, and
all the subgoals generated in response to this
operator are removed—they are now irrelevant.
For example, if the desired lateral separation
is achieved, then the termination condition
of the cut-to-LS operator is achieved.
The operator is then terminated and replaced
by the maintain-LS operator—to maintain lateral
separation—and its subgoal and associated
problem space (desired-maneuver) are
flushed. Similarly, if a missile-firing position
is reached, the termination condition of LL’s
get-missile-LAR operator is satisfied; hence, it
is terminated along with the two subgoals
beneath it.

= SOAR and ACTORY  =

SOAR's core implementation is based on rules. Why? Cog Sci research in the 1970s.

What would an SE/OO version of SOAR look like?  Not rules, but (possibly stochastic) finite state machines.
States as objects. Machines as objects. Not "nested problem spaces"  but nested calls to machines. 

What would chunking  (learning) look like over stochastic finite state machines? Learn biases on transition selection.

One similarity: SOAR's rule selection mechanism for its rules is a bunch of rules.  Similarly, our control strategy could be a master FSM that fires off an machine that says if any machine has stopped firing new transitions, ask that machine what are its sub-goals and fire off one of those.

Semiautomated forces tend to be developed as
combinations of finite-state machines (FSMs)
and arbitrary code (Calder et al. 1993). 

 * This strategy has proven adequate for encoding fragments of well-defined behavior 
 * But,  so far, have fallen considerably short of autonomously competent behavior (thus requiring frequent intervention by knowledgeable humans). 

FSM
languages are simply  restrictive to support
the representation of humanlike intelligence.
 * The ability to use arbitrary code does provide significant improvements in flexibility.
 * This flexibility of language unfortunately does not by itself translate into flexibility of behavior by the system that is programmed within the language. 
 * What is missing is higher-level support necessary to enable such behavioral flexibility, such as the support for
  *  dynamic integration of knowledge during behavior and goal-driven problem solving and planning

Most of the systems that go beyond the
simple FSM strategy are structured as simple
rule-based expert systems for tactical decision
making:

 *  Given TacAir-Soar’s own knowledgeintensive (rule-based) approach to decision making, it does share some similarities with such systems. 
 * However, standard rule-based syste,s they are weak in other areas. 
 * For example, in a standard rule-based approach, it is difficult to capture the complexity of the multiple dynamic goals about which pilots must reason. 
 * In addition, these systems typically rely only on high-level tactical knowledge and, as a result, prove to be rather rigid—unless they can be preprogrammed for every possible contingency, their performance degrades greatly when faced with unexpected situations.
 * Finally, expert systems generally ignore the other cognitive aspects of the task, such as modeling of other agents in the environment and behaving in a humanlike manner. 

Soar was specifically constructed to overcome such limitations of standard rule-based expert systems.

Besides Soar, one other system in this class that attempts to provide for flexible behavior is a recent effort at the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (Rao et al. 1993) that attempts to use the procedural reasoning system
(PRS) (Georgeff and Lansky 1986) as a basis for modeling pilots in air-combat simulation.

 * However, this effort does not yet appear to be far enough along to evaluate the extent to which it can actually provide such flexibility in this demanding domain.

The second class of systems includes those
based on other AI agent architectures that
attempt the integration of a variety of component
capabilities. 
 * Unfortunately, the characteristics of the space of agent designs and architectures are not well enough understood to enable a clear understanding of the relationship between TacAir-Soar and these other systems. 
 * About the best we can do at this point is to compare the number and types of capabilities exhibited by these systems. 
 * Based on such an evaluation, TacAir-Soar appears to be one of a very few systems that integrate so many distinct capabilities 


Other systems use variants of TAC-SOAR: see paper.
