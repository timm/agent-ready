= Say "hello" to GRAPH =

"GRAPH", a tiny ascii GRAPH utility written by 
by Alfred V. Aho, Brian W. Kernighan, and Peter J. Weinberger. In inputs files that look like this:
{{{
label here's some stuff
bottom ticks 1 2 5 10
left ticks 1 2 10 20
range 1 1 10 20
height 10
width 30
1 2 *
2 4 * 
3 6 *
4 8 *
}}}

And outputs stuff that looks like this:
{{{
20    -----------------------|
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
10    -       *              |
      |    *                 |
      |  *                   |
2     *--|------|------------|
     1  2      5            10
         here's some stuff    
}}}
A sample implementation is supplied at 
http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1/graph.awk .

Sample input files can be found at 
http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1/eg .
For example
the above input file is actually 
http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1/eg/1

To generate a graph, using GRAPH,
run
{{{
gawk -f graph.awk eg/1
}}}

Graphs can contain multiple lines, so you can generate bar
graphs as follows. This input:
{{{
label mean IQ
left ticks  0 10 20 30 40
height 20
width  30
3 1 *
3 2 * 
3 3 *
3 4 *
3 5 *
3 6 *
3 7 *
7 1 +
7 2 +
7 3 +
7 4 +
7 5 +
7 6 +
7 7 +
7 8 +
7 9 +
7 10 +
7 11 +
7 12 +
7 13 +
range 0 0 10 20
tags  3 boys 7 girls  
}}}
Generates this output (note the error message on line 1 saying that
"tags" is not found
{{{

= Annoyances (which need to be fixed) =
== Tags not supported ==

he current implementation does not add tags to bar
graphs. The above output should have been:
{{{
20    -----------------------|
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |               +      |
      |               +      |
10    -               +      |
      |               +      |
      |               +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
0     -------|--------|------|
             boys     girls   
              mean IQ         
}}}
This desired output can be found at
http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1a/eg/6.want .

== Tedious specifications ==

Another tedious feature of the current implementation is that
the bar graphs have to be hard-coded using lines and lines of numbers.
Ideally, we should be able to write bar graphs using the following
shorthand:
{{{
label mean IQ
left ticks  0 10 20 30 40
height 20
width  30
range 0 0 10 20
tag 3 boys 7 *
tag 7 girls 13 +
}}}
== Quirks (that you should accept) ==

Your OO/functional/logical
versions of this this system should all produce the
same output as the reference system.
Except for the annoyances listed above,
the reference implementation should be treated
as "the" implementation.
This means that you must understand the reference system,
warts and all, in order to reproduce it in other languages.

= The Problem =

The current version of GRAPH is broken, as revealed by the following
test engine:
{{{
cd proj1
make score
?? line 12: [tags  2 things]
?? line 26: [tags  3 boys 7 girls  ]
?? line 6: [tags  3 apples 10 oranges 16 pears]
?? line 5: [tag 2 things 7 *]
?? line 6: [tag 3 boys 7 *]
?? line 7: [tag 7 girls 13 +]
?? line 3: [tag 3 apple 7 *]
?? line 4: [tag 10 oranges 24 +]
?? line 5: [tag 16 pears 16 $]
   6 FAILED
   4 PASSED
}}}
That is, the current system fails 6 of its current tests. You need
to fix that. To do that, you'll need to:

 # Understand the GRAPH system
 # Set up the files
 # Understand the test engine
 # Understand what is causing the above failures
 # Fix the implementation.
