<h2>Say "hello" to GRAPH</h2>
<p>"GRAPH", a tiny ascii GRAPH utility written by 
by Alfred V. Aho, Brian W. Kernighan, and Peter J. Weinberger. In inputs files that look like this:
{{{
label here's some stuff
bottom ticks 1 2 5 10
left ticks 1 2 10 20
range 1 1 10 20
height 10
width 30
1 2 *
2 4 * 
3 6 *
4 8 *
}}}

And outputs stuff that looks like this:
{{{
20    -----------------------|
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
10    -       *              |
      |    *                 |
      |  *                   |
2     *--|------|------------|
     1  2      5            10
         here's some stuff    
}}}
<p>A sample implementation is supplied at 
<a href="http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1/graph.awk">
http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1a/GRAPH.awk</a>
and understanding it will take up most of the time of project1.
<p>Sample input files can be found at 
<a href="http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1/eg">
http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1a/eg</a>. For example,
the above input file is actually 
<a href="http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1/eg/1">
eg/1</a>. 

To generate a graph, using GRAPH,
run
{{{
gawk -f graph.awk eg/1
}}}
<p>Graphs can contain multiple lines, so you can generate bar
graphs as follows. This input:
{{{
label mean IQ
left ticks  0 10 20 30 40
height 20
width  30
3 1 *
3 2 * 
3 3 *
3 4 *
3 5 *
3 6 *
3 7 *
7 1 +
7 2 +
7 3 +
7 4 +
7 5 +
7 6 +
7 7 +
7 8 +
7 9 +
7 10 +
7 11 +
7 12 +
7 13 +
range 0 0 10 20
tags  3 boys 7 girls  
}}}
Generates this output (note the error message on line 1 saying that
<b><i>tags</i></b> is not found
{{{

<h2>Annoyances (which you will fix)</h2>
<h3>Tags not supported</h3>

<p>The current implementation does not add tags to bar
graphs. The above output should have been:
{{{
20    -----------------------|
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |               +      |
      |               +      |
10    -               +      |
      |               +      |
      |               +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
      |      *        +      |
0     -------|--------|------|
             boys     girls   
              mean IQ         
}}}
<p>(This desired output can be found at
<a href="http://unbox.org/wisp/var/timm/09/310/lib/proj1a/eg/6.want">
eg/6.want</a>).
<h3>Tedious specifications</h3>
<p>Another tedious feature of the current implementation is that
the bar graphs have to be hard-coded using lines and lines of numbers.
Ideally, we should be able to write bar graphs using the following
shorthand:
{{{
label mean IQ
left ticks  0 10 20 30 40
height 20
width  30
range 0 0 10 20
tag 3 boys 7 *
tag 7 girls 13 +
}}}
<h2>Quirks (that you will accept)</h2>
<p> 

Your OO/functional/logical
versions of this this system should all produce the
same output as the reference system.
Except for the annoyances listed above,
the reference implementation should be treated
as <b><i>the</i></b> implementation.
<p>This means that you must understand the reference system,
warts and all, in order to reproduce it in other languages.<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The current version of GRAPH is broken, as revealed by the following
test engine:
{{{
cd proj1
make score
?? line 12: [tags  2 things]
?? line 26: [tags  3 boys 7 girls  ]
?? line 6: [tags  3 apples 10 oranges 16 pears]
?? line 5: [tag 2 things 7 *]
?? line 6: [tag 3 boys 7 *]
?? line 7: [tag 7 girls 13 +]
?? line 3: [tag 3 apple 7 *]
?? line 4: [tag 10 oranges 24 +]
?? line 5: [tag 16 pears 16 $]
   6 FAILED
   4 PASSED
}}}
That is, the current system fails 6 of its current tests. You need
to fix that. To do that, you'll need to:
<ol>
<li>Understand the GRAPH system
<li>Set up the files
<li>Understand the test engine
<li>Understand what is causing the above failures

<li>Fix the implementation.
</ol>
