\section{Introduction}
In this project we focus on modeling a system capable of tracking
people inside a building so their location is always known. 
The building is divided into floors that in turn are divided into a six-by-six
grid where each square is either a room or a segment of a hall. A room can be either
a classroom, a restroom, a snack room, an office, a conference room, an elevator, 
a stairway, or an office.
Tracking is possible thanks to a series of static sensors placed in various places around
each floor and personal sensors carried by professors inside the building. 
The challenge is to find the best strategical placement of the static sensors so
they can detect the mobile sensors at any point in time. This way, te minimal number
of sensors is used and the system costs are minimized.
