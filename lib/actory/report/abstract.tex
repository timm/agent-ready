\begin{abstract}
This report describes the design and implementation of an agent-based
system with the goal of placing the minimum number of sensors in a
building able to locate the people inside at any given time.
In this first iteration of the system, it behaves randomly based on a set of parameters.
In the next hase, it  will include intelligence
componenst that will learn optimal parameter setting that shape the behaviors of the different agents and adjust
the paths agents follow in order to optimize the system's behavior.

{\bf Keywords:} Intelligent Agents, Artificial Intelligence.
