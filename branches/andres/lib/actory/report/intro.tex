\section{Introduction}
In this project we focus on modeling a system capable of tracking
people inside a building so their location is always known. 
The building is divided into floors that in turn are divided into a six-by-six
grid where each square is ether a room or a segment of a hall. A room can be either
a classroom, a restroom, a snack room an office, a conference room, an elevator, 
a stairway  or an office.
Tracking
is possible thanks to a series of static sensors placed in various places around
each floor and personal sensors carried by people inside the building.
 
The challenge is to find the best strategical placement of the static sensors so
they can detect the mobile sensors at any point in time. All sensors have a maximum
range of detection based on the signal power selected when configured. The signal
power selected has a direct impact on battery life.
