\begin{abstract}
This report describes the design and implementation of an agent-based
system with the goal of placing the minimum number of sensors in a
building able to locate the people inside at any given time.
In this first iteration of the system, it behaves randomly based on a set of parameters.
In the next phase, it  will include intelligent
components that will learn optimal parameter setting shaping the behaviors of the different agents and adjusting
the paths agents follow in order to minimize configuration costs while maximizing detection rates.

{\bf Keywords:} Intelligent Agents, Artificial Intelligence.
