\begin{abstract}
This report describes the design and implementation of an agent-based
system whose goal is to place the minimum number of sensors in a
building while being able to locate people inside at any given time.
This first iteration of the system does not include the intelligence
component that learns the behaviors of the different agents and adjust
the paths agents follow. All agents follow pre-established paths at
random.

{\bf Keywords:} Intelligent Agents, Artificial Intelligence.
