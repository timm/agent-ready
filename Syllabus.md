<br>
<h1>Expected Workload</h1>

You MUST be prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a week<br>
to this class (excluding the time spent in the classroom). A minimal<br>
prerequisite for the successful completion is good understanding<br>
of programming concepts. You will be given class accounts on CS<br>
Department machines and all assignments will have to be submitted<br>
and run there. Please note that a Linux server can be accessed from<br>
any PC using a secure connection service, such as SSH (explanation<br>
to be provided in class).<br>
<br>
<h1>Assessment</h1>

1. <i>(10 marks)</i> September 11, 2009: Smalltalk 101 exercise (implementing a domain-specific language for the <a href='Graph.md'>language</a>.<br>
<br>
2. October 5, 2009:<br>
<ul><li><i>(10 marks)</i> A real world object-oriented agent system demonstrating at least Woolridige's weak agency.<br>
</li><li><i>(10 marks)</i> Essay: perform baseline results for the OO agent systems. Includes a description of your model, the DSL used for that model, and <a href='http://t16web.lanl.gov/Kawano/gnuplot/index-e.html'>Gnuplots</a> of base line results. 4 pages, pdf submission <a href='http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates'>Latex, ACM tighter alternative style</a></li></ul>

3. November 2,2009<br>
<ul><li>Essay: 4 pages, pdf submission <a href='http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates'>Latex, ACM tighter alternative style</a>.<br>
<ul><li><i>(10 marks)</i> summary of agents theory (2 pages)<br>
</li><li><i>(10 marks)</i> summary of data minign theory (2 pages)<br>
</li></ul></li><li><i>(10 marks)</i> Data mining utils, coded in Smalltalk</li></ul>

4. <i>(10 marks)</i> November 16, 2009: data mining results on the model (lots of Gnuplots).<br>
<br>
5. <i>(30 marks)</i> Nov 30: final report. In a format suitable for ACM conference submission.  Includes a rework and extension of 2,3 and 4.<br>
<br>
Late marks: 2 marks off per day (weekend = 1 day)<br>
<br>
See also, below, for how to lose marks due to poor attendance.<br>
<br>
For special consideration on the above, either:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>See me at start of semester advising planned absences or<br>
</li><li>provide a doctor's certificate indicating that the student was unable to work on their studies for a relevant period (that note need NOT name the illness, but should list its duration).</li></ul>

Students must regularly commit their work to a code repository provided by the lecturer. This repository will be monitored by the lecturer and students who are not making regular commits will be told to opt out of the group projects and work on their own.<br>
<br>
Students can choose, or be told, to opt out of the group projects. If so, they will write 2*2000 essays for each remaining project in the term. They will also loose 7.5 marks from their end-of-year grade.<br>
<br>
<h1>Attendance policy</h1>

Students are expected to regularly attend all lectures. After three noted absences, students will lose two points per absence. After three noted lated arrivals, students will lose one point per late arrival. If you have another commitment that requires you to be consistently late, you should drop the class.<br>
<br>
<h1>Social Justice Statement</h1>

West Virginia University is committted to social justice. I concur with that commitment and expect to foster a nurturing learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. Our University does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in this class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.<br>
<br>
If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with Disability Services (293-6700).<br>
<br>
<h1>Statement of Academic Integrity</h1>

The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course.<br>
<br>
For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the Student Conduct Code at <a href='http://www.arc.wvu.edu/admissions/integrity.html'>http://www.arc.wvu.edu/admissions/integrity.html</a>. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter
